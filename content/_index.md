NEW FROM ROB:
The 4D Perception Lab (4DPL) is a fusion of the previous 3D Perception Lab and the Hyperspectral Research Unit, where the “4D” refers to 3 spatial and 1 spectral dimension.
The unit’s goal is to make sense of our surroundings through geometric (spatial) and chemical (spectral) measurements.
The current main focus is on portable, passive systems that can be used on the modern battlefield, mainly centered around the detection of land and sea mines, UXO and IED.

More generally, we aim to 
- build digital twins of battlefield environments
- study and implement spectroscopic, spatial and spatial-spectral target, anomaly, change and target detection algorithms (including ML-based algorithms). Targets can include explosive ordnance, biological warfare agents and chemical warfare agents.
- analyze combustion processes
- enhance data fusion between different types of electro-optical sensors

The **4D Perception Lab** is a research unit within the [Royal Military Academy (RMA)](https://rma.ac.be/) of Belgium. 
The lab focuses on the research and development of spatial perception systems with spectral sensing capabilities.
The unit’s goal is to make sense of our surroundings through geometric (spatial) and chemical (spectral) measurements.
The current main focus is on **portable, passive systems that can be used on the modern battlefield**. An important application of our work is the detection of land and sea mines, UXO and IED.
