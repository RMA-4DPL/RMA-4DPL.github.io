## Overview

In the framework of the study RAVN (Rapid Aerial Vehicle Neutralization), we are looking for a full-time researcher in computer vision and/or robotics with a Master degree in Engineering Science, Applied Sciences, Civil Engineering, Physics, Computer Science or Mathematics.

The RAVN project aims to develop a multi-drone system capable of detecting, tracking, and neutralizing hostile drone swarms in complex, GNSS-denied environments. The system combines multiple autonomous aerial platforms that collaborate to achieve real-time situational awareness through distributed sensing, mapping, and coordination. Our goal is to integrate advanced perception and localization algorithms on drones that will be provided by project partners to enable coordinated multi-agent autonomy and threat response.

The Royal Military Academy is fully recognized as a university, fulfilling the same criteria as civilian universities. The RMA is also conducting scientific research at university level for projects funded by the Belgian Defense department or external sources.

We value diversity and equal opportunities. We firmly believe that diversity enriches our community, and we encourage all qualified candidates to apply.


## Key Responsibilities

- Development of algorithms for SLAM using onboard sensors such as cameras and IMUs. These algorithms will provide accurate 3D localization and mapping in real-time, even under challenging conditions (e.g., high dynamics, low texture, or degraded visibility).
- Research and implementation of multi-agent localization techniques with sensor fusion including RADAR and UWB for cooperative perception among multiple UAVs.
- Participation in field experiments and measurement campaigns to validate performance in realistic counter-UAS scenarios.
- Preparation of scientific publications and contributions to project deliverables.


## Qualifications

Degree(s) required: Master Degree in Engineering Science, Applied Sciences, Civil Engineering, Physics, Computer Science or Mathematics.
This position is open for junior profiles (ideally 0-3 years of experience) in computer vision and/or robotics.
