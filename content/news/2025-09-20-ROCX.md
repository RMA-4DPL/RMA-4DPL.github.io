## 4DPL Participates in ROCX 2025

In September 2025, the 4D Perception Lab participated in **ROCX 2025** (RIT Open Community eXperimentn), a large-scale community remote sensing experiment coordinated by RIT's Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing (DIRS) Laboratory. Building on similar experiments conducted in 2010 and 2012, ROCX 2025 brought together more than 60 researchers and professionals from around the globe to RIT's Tait Preserve for a two-week data collection campaign.

The experiment featured approximately 20 ground-based and 20 remote sensing experiments using satellites, aircraft, drones, and ground-based instruments. The goal of these experiments is to drive the remote sensing domain forward in many aspects by creating novel valuable data sets for educational and research purposes. 
The datasets will be made publicly available by summer 2026.

## UXO Detection Experiment

As part of ROCX 2025, the 4D Perception Lab, in collaboration with RIT's DIRS Laboratory, set up a controlled **Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) detection experiment**. 

The UXO experiment involved:
- **Deployment of 120 3D-printed PFM-1 mines**.
- **Ground-based multi-sensor data collection** using a handheld sensor rig, collect ground-based multi-spectral and panchromatic NIR, visible, SWIR and thermal data.
- **Coordinated airborne collections** with drones and aircraft to capture multi-modal high-resolution spatial-spectral data.
- **Ground truth measurements** documenting accurate GPS locations, calibration targets and reflectance measurements.

This work directly supports 4DPL's ongoing research in landmine and UXO detection using passive, stand-off hyperspectral imaging techniques. The collected dataset will enable the development and validation of advanced detection algorithms, including machine learning approaches, for identifying PFM-1 mines.
