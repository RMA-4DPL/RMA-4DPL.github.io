## Seminar: Hyperspectral Imaging for Military and Security Applications: Combining Myriad Processing and Sensing Techniques

{{< paper_abstract >}}
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) allows capturing detailed spectral information for each pixel within the FOV of your camera. Unlike traditional imaging systems that capture data in three primary bands (red, green, and blue), HSI acquires detailed spectral information across hundreds of contiguous bands, even in wavelength ranges not visible with the naked eye, at each pixel within the field of view of the camera. This enables precise identification and classification of materials and objects based on their unique spectral signatures, even when they are visually indistinguishable. Key applications for defence include camouflage detection, explosive material identification, assessing the condition of equipment or infrastructure, surveillance, and enhanced situational awareness in complex and dynamic environments. Advancements in sensor technology, data processing algorithms, and machine learning techniques have significantly improved the application range, the real-time usability and the accuracy of HSI systems in operational scenarios. Additionally, the miniaturization of hardware and development of lightweight platforms, such as drones and handheld devices, have extended hyperspectral imaging usability in previously inaccessible terrains. The image data can be combined with data from other sensors, such as LIDAR, to even further increase target knowledge. This presentation explores the principles of HSI, its applications in defense and security, emerging challenges, as well as current HSI projects at the Belgian Royal Military Academy.
