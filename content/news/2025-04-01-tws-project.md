We are excited to announce that the **Threat Warning Sensor (TWS)** project has been approved under the Defence-related Research Action 'New Generation Combat Aircraft Technologies' (DEFRA-NGCAT) program. This project aims to develop a high-accuracy, real-time threat warning system with the lowest possible size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C), utilizing advanced hyperspectral sensors and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to detect and categorize missile threats with minimal false alerts.

The project will run from August 2025 to February 2028 and is coordinated by RSV srl, with RMA's 4D Perception Lab as a key partner alongside FN Herstal, VITO and Verhaert.
