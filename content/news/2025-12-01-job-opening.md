## Overview

In the framework of the study ARIES (Advanced Resolution and Intelligence for Explosive Sensing), we are looking for a full-time researcher with a Master degree in Engineering Science, Applied Sciences, Civil Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics or related discipline.

ARIES aims at the development of a sensor fusion-based surface mine detection framework for different operational scenarios by investigating new technology developments such as new types of sensors, the fusion of these sensors and state-of-the-art image processing techniques.

In this project we will:

- Investigate the performance of hyperspectral and multispectral sensors to detect and categorize spectral signatures of landmines.
- Compare/Develop traditional vs. AI driven sensor processing algorithms for high accuracy detection and identification of relevant targets
- Develop sensor fusion algorithms to combine hyperspectral, multispectral and other sensor modalities for mine detection.
- Build a spectral imaging signature library of relevant targets.

The Royal Military Academy is fully recognized as a university, fulfilling the same criteria as civilian universities. The RMA is also conducting scientific research at university level for projects funded by the Belgian Defense department or external sources.

We value diversity and equal opportunities. We firmly believe that diversity enriches our community, and we encourage all qualified candidates to apply.


## Key Responsibilities

- Development of a mine detection sensor system based on hyperspectral sensor fusion and advanced AI/ML processing techniques
- Organisation of measurement campaigns, partly on military grounds, using state of the art (hyper)spectral sensors
- Publish research findings in top-tier conferences and journals
- Contribute to the lab's ongoing research initiatives
- Exploring opportunities to leverage the results of this project


## Qualifications

Degree(s) required / ideal degree(s): Master degree in Engineering Science, Applied Sciences, Civil Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics or related discipline with 0 to 3 years of experience.
