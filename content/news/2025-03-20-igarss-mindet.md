{{< paper_abstract >}}
Recent events in Ukraine have shown that the
humble landmine still represents a formidable obstacle to maneuver warfare. Even after a conflict ends, these indiscriminate
weapons continue to do harm to the civilian population. Different
techniques to detect landmines exist, but few are passive, stand-
off, automated and/or efficient. The superior discrimination capabilities of hyperspectral imaging have the potential to identify,
characterize, or quantify target objects in a scene, as each
material has unique reflective characteristics in the ultraviolet
(UV), visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared
(SWIR) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Furthermore,
thermal and soil anomalies can be captured in the longwave
(LWIR) – and to a lesser extent, the midwave (MWIR) – infrared.
In this paper we briefly describe the possible use of hyperspectral
imagers, mounted on a UAV or UGV, to detect landmines.
