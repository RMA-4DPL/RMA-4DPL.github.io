Deep learning methods have seen great success for superresolution tasks over a variety of domains. However, for
super-resolution in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) one of the
bottlenecks for performance is the availability of high-quality
training data sets with high spatial resolution. This issue is
further exacerbated in the case of HSI spectral domains for
which accessible data is even more scarce, such as those in
the infrared range. To address this problem, we propose a
novel unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation method
that allows the transfer of knowledge from a model trained
on hyperspectral images from a range of the electromagnetic
spectrum with high-resolution training data to a target spectral range where ground truth high-resolution data is unavailable. We illustrate the performance of our method on a novel
hyperspectral data set in the short-wave infrared (SWIR)
spectrum. When applying our domain adaptation method, a
performance increase can be observed, compared to standard
super-resolution methods, in the target domain. The implementation and data set are publicly available on the repository: https://github.com/RMA-4DPL/A-SNLSR.
