## Context
The recent rise in the use of explosive ordnance (EO), such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and landmines in conflicts, has been a major cause of casualties among EU and NATO troops, accounting for about 50% of soldier deaths. The BELGIAN project aims to address this significant military challenge by developing unmanned ground vehicles with semi-autonomous capabilities for handling EOs. This technology seeks to enhance the safety of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations by minimizing the direct exposure of human operators to these hazardous conditions.

## Objectives
Perception & environmental understanding for object manipulation
- Object reconstruction in unknown and unstructured environments
- Semi-autonomous operation, enabling seamless switchover to robotic deminers
- Advanced human-machine interaction for fully situational awareness

## Methodology
To tackle the problem, the methodology includes conducting test campaigns to refine the unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), continuously updating its design and functions based on field data. Additionally, we will adjust and release datasets to the public to enhance transparency and foster innovation. The methodology also involves direct campaigns with soldiers to ensure the UGV meets real-world operational needs and to integrate soldier feedback into further development.
