## Context
The project aims to overcome some of the current technological gaps of the hyperspectral technologies in
the defence sector by developing a technological demonstrator for space and airborne remote sensing
applications.

## Objectives
HYPER-IP project will progress the state of the art by developing an advanced miniaturized and militarized SWaP-C (Small Size, Weight, Power and Cost) demonstrator to achieve high performance in terms of signal to noise ratio and frame rate. The demonstrator will be integrated with a processing tool to enable real time understanding of the data. The final goal is to develop a hyperspectral system (imager and real time processor) to be used on small spaceborne platforms.

## Methodology
To overcome issues linked to SWIR spectral bands, new promising solutions for Hyperspectral short infrared imagers will be analysed and new technical approaches to achieve better SWaP-C factors will be studied. Specifically, the use of nanostructured surfaces, rapid tuneable filters and
snapshot imagers technologies will be considered. For a trade-off analysis of the development of the small hyperspectral demonstrator for the European Defence, a model and simulation of the identified solutions
will be conducted. A new processing solution will be designed and developed to overcome the challenges associated with the processing of the large amount of data in real time. New methodologies for target
detection, material classifications and spectral matching will be analysed and studied. The use of advanced machine learning techniques including AI and deep learning will be considered in order to better understand the acquired data. Potential computational system architectures (i.e. HW and SW) for real time processing will be identified and implemented. Processing techniques will be adopted and tested using real
and simulated imaging data. Validation of the new design concepts will be achieved through the use of an airborne platform.
