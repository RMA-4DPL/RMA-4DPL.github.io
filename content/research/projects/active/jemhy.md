## Context
The current method of jet engine health monitoring at Belgian air bases is considered to be time- and cost innefficient as it requires to open up the engine to extract oil samples and analyze them in the lab. A method to facilitate this process by assessing jet engine health and the need to conduct preventive maintenance in a non-intrusive manner would be of great interest. 

## Objectives
"- Asses the spectral and spatial features in jet engine exhaust plumes indicative of engine degradation and engine component failure
- Develop the sensor suite capable of meeting the requirements of detecting early degradation in jet engines
- Develop ML algorithms capable of detecting early degradation in jet engines based on hyperspectral observations of echaust plumes"

## Methodology
Through real observations and intricate modelling of jet engine exhaust plumes, develop a large database of HSI measurements that allows training ML models to be able to detect the necessity of preventive mainenance of the engines.
