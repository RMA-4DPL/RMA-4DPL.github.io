## Context
The proliferation of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS),
particularly mini-class drones (<15 kg), poses an increasingly complex threat to military and civilian infrastructure. On the detection side, traditional counter-UAS systems often rely on static sensors and manual operations, offering limited scalability, sluggish response times, and vulnerability in GNSS-denied environments.

## Objectives
The RAVN project responds to both to these challenges by introducing a next-generation, modular, and scalable Counter-UAS system that can both detect further away from the target and respond while the threat is not yet close to the target. 


## Methodology
RAVN combines advanced radar without rotational detection lag, with computer vision and advanced sensor fusion, with C-UAS deployed away from the target using autonomous GNSS-free navigation capability and providing directed kinetic response and taking advantage of UWB adhoc inter-drone positioning and communication.
