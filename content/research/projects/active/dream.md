## Context
Autonomous robots are being deployed in more and more complex environments (notably with the advent of legged robots). This study is aimed at improving the execution of reconnaissance and mapping operations with a proof-of-concept system consisting of multiple unmanned ground robots with robotic arms that allow basic manipulations in the environment and a VR command console.

## Objectives
The work consists in integrating the robot platforms, the robotic arms and VR technology in an ensemble system for shared situational awareness that is as accurate, efficient and user-friendly as possible.

## Methodology
For SLAM: Development of single agent SLAM, development of a multi-agent SLAM baseline, development of advanced multi-agent SLAM systems. For arm manipulations: development of a simple manipulation pipeline, development of a fragile object handling pipeline (e.g. landmine).
