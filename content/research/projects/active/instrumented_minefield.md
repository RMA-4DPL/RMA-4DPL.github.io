## Context
The use of a simulated minefield in a controlled environment allows for the meticulous study and testing of demining techniques and technologies, providing a safe yet realistic setting for training and research without real-world risks.

## Objectives
Building a minefield, both indoors and outdoors to capture varous Ground Truth parameters

## Methodology
Building an indoor and outdoor sandbox + instrumentation for measurements performed in other studies
