## Context
The objective of the SSAVE project is to develop a framework enabling shared situational awareness for maritime vessels. Advancements in connected and maritime vehicles are severely constrained by the limitations of existing communication methodologies and data exchange information. Due to the insecure nature of the current information sharing platform (like AIS) between vessels, information sharing is vulnerable to spoofing. Also the data content of AIS, today, Is estimated to be 100% correct in only 30% of the cases. AIS update rates are too low to be valuable in autonomous systems and further decrease when many assets are active simultaneously within one zone. 


## Objectives
The goal is to improve data quality, interconnectivity and interoperability between assets in the maritime and inland waterway environment. This will be achieved by allowing secure and verified direct and indirect communication between assets. The exchanged data information will be extended with additional sensor information to efficiently represent and communicate shared situational awareness. This sensor data extension, representation and communication is a crucial step towards efficient and flexible interoperability.
