## Context
The efficient characterization of military target infrared (IR) signature plays an important role in any countermeasure Defence program from automatic detection and recognition of potential threats to the design of aircraft and missile guidance seekers and interceptors. A special effort has been invested in the last decade in integrating IR based technology in ballistic missile Defence systems (BMDS).

Analyzing the IR signature of a combustion plume goes far beyond the military applications. Effective performance analysis of combustion processes of engines is important to guarantee operational efficiency, reduce environmental pollution and secure human life and assets.

## Objectives
The aim of this research was the analysis of the combustion plume of rocket and turbojet engines using an advanced hyperspectral system from several platforms. The project was realized in close collaboration with National and International military components and industry, assessing the sensing techniques in an operational environment and drawing a road map for future technological development.

## Methodology
The detection and the tracking of the rocket are associated with the thermal emission and distribution within the combustion plume, whereas the velocity is associated with the combustion species and their distribution. Spectroscopy is widely used for combustion analysis using various diagnostic techniques. Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) extends these capacities by generating 3D images with enhanced spectral and spatial information. Several research projects have demonstrated the advantages of the technique, but their objectives were limited to a single scanning platform and to liquid propulsion systems.
