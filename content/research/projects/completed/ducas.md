## Context
The four year project Detection in Urban scenario using Combined Airborne imaging Sensors (DUCAS) was initiated in 2009 by seven countries within the European Defence Agency (EDA) framework. The aim of the project was to investigate the potential benefit of combined high spatial and spectral resolution airborne imagery for several defence applications in the urban area. The project took advantage of the combined resources from contributing nations.

## Objectives
- Determine the detection, recognition and identification performance of difficult targets in an urban environment using combined hyperspectral and high spatial resolution active and passive sensors, in comparison with conventional techniques,
- Evaluate the improvement of the situation awareness and surveillance capability in complex urban areas,
- Propose conceptual system design for those application areas where the benefit of combined hyperspectral and high spatial resolution active and passive sensors is clear.
